## Students: Carlos Santana & Andrew Brudnak

Our application incorporates some great technologies such as the following listed below. Carlos Santana & Andrew Brudnak pair programmed throughout the week in nearly nonstop Zoom conference calls. We were able to achieve full CRUD functionality in both our Contacts, and Random Acts data. We are also displaying a randomly generated contact and a random act of kindness to be paired with each other.

### JSON-Server

Our application uses [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) because of some delays with our back end. Although this provides a real world simulation for connecting to an API.

### **Running the Application _Locally_**

After you run the initial npm install when cloning the repository. To run the application correctly with json-server you’ll need to **npm run dev**.
